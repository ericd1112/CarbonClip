        <p>Based upon research at Cambridge University, the CarbonClip (patent pending) is a carbon fiber clip angle, for attaching curtain wall framing to a building's structure, while eliminating the thermal shorts that come with traditional metal clip angles. Available for use and manufacture under license.</p>

        <p>On the left is an image of a conventional aluminum curtain wall anchoring a typical aluminum curtain wall mullion.
		<br/>On the right is an illustration showing the CarbonClip carbon fiber reinforced polymer (“carbon fiber”) clip angle, bolted to floor slab closure angle, and to a typical vertical extruded aluminum curtain wall mullion. Design can be used at locations of sleeved mullion connections (as shown) or for continuous mullion. Dimensions are approximate and to be adapted based upon lateral and gravity loads, fastener types, etc.

    	<p>Illustrations showing a fabricated prototype carbon fiber clip angle. The sizes of the legs of the angle will vary for the geometries of the specific project application and the calculated loads. The locations, directions, and dimensions of bolting slots can be shop fabricated or, because of the nature of the CFRP material, could also be field cut. It is also the nature of the material, applied in this unique way, that nearly eliminates the ”thermal shorts” or conduction of heat from the interior structure to the exterior envelope, which occurs with the aluminum example illustrated above. Both images are of an actual prototype.
